You will receive an email with the tracking number when you order is dispatched to the carrier's sort facility. </span></p>\n<p><span>For some shipping companies, it can take several days for the tracking information to update in the system.

If the order has already been processed through our shipping department, we cannot retrieve it for an address change. </p>\n<p>It is the customers responsibility to nominate a safe and secure shipping address. Zomario is not responsible for for missing or stolen packages once an order has been delivered to the correct shipping address. Zomario is not liable for any damage to parcels once successfully delivered to the correct shipping address.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>We would love to hear your feedback, questions, or any concerns.
